# Imagine the following scenario: You are a data analyst at an organisation. You 
# have been given a data set and asked to create a meaningful data visualisation using this data.
# 
# Using the ggplot in-built data sets in RStudio and the qplot
# function, get your creative juices flowing and create a meaningful 
# and impactful data visualization using your preferred data set.

# Seeing what inbuilt datasets are available to me.
