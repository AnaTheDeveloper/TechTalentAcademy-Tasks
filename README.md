Whilst completing the Data Visualisation section I initially struggled to display the graph in Pycharm. After researching, I found the solution was to go to View -> Scientific View, which opened up a new tab in PyCharm. After some more research into a basic graph that I could get up and running I was able to display a simple graph. This let me know that the graph feature was working and that the issue was someonewhere in my code. Using the holidays destinations as an example for my data source, i made an Excel for it then saved it as a csv and then imported it into Pycharm. I then took each section of data I wanted and assigned it to its own variable. One for the x axis and one for the y axis. Then the graph appears. But the names are all overlapping each other. This was because some of my data had overlapping values and so it got put on top of each other. I fixed this by changing the graph design and values. I then looked at how to add axis labels and a title. I also looked at how to change the colour of my values and rotation. For the Correlation graph I initially assigned everything to its own values and had about 20 lines of code. After some more research I cut down my code to almost half the size and it made my code look more readable. I then fiddled around with the correlation graph line colour and the values colours and then came to my final graph which can be seen above.

Artificial Intelligence collects, stores, processes vast amounts of data. With so much data being processed General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) laws are becoming progressively more important.

Responsible Artificial Intelligence is the practise of developing and deploying artificial intelligence with good intensions that will have a positive impact on businesses and customers. The more business decisions are put in the hands of AI the more important Responsible AI is to reinstall trust and confidence.

A famous case where artificial intelligence failed miserably was in 2013 when IBM partnered with the University of Texas to develop a new ‘Oncology Expert Advisor (OEA)’ system with the goal to cure cancer. IBM’s role was to enable medical professionals to discover valuable information from cancer patient and research databases. In 2018 the project was reviewed by StatNews and they found that the OEA artificial intelligence system was suggesting dangerous cancer treatments. One suggestion from the system artificial intelligence was to combat severe bleeding in a patient with a drug that worsened bleeding. The projects main problem mainly came down to the IBM engineers as they trained the software on a small number of hypothetical caner patients, rather than real patient data. In 2017 Forbes reported that the project has been “benched”. Overall, the project ended up overspending $62 million and they didn’t even reach their goals.

Some implications of artificial intelligence are that systems based on supervised learning could be potentially trained on past human judgement and therefore reproduce the strengths and weaknesses of the humans who made these judgements, including their tendencies of error and prejudice. For example, a recruitment system trained on the past hiring decisions will learn to mimic the managers' assessment of the suitability of candidates, rather than to directly predict an applicant's performance at work. 
This can lead to unintended consequences like the incident with Google Photos AI.  In this case the system identified and tagged two black friends as ‘Gorillas’. Later on Twitter after the tweet went viral, Google publicly apologised.

The Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on Artificial Intelligence Report 2020: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/641530/EPRS_STU(2020)641530_EN.pdf 

There are three ways that I have identified in which organisations can be more responsible with artificial intelligence. The first way in which cooperation’s can be more responsible is by investing in education around artificial intelligence and its capabilities. By training and informing those involved of the implications and benefits of artificial intelligence allows the best decisions around artificial intelligence can be made. However, for those important decisions to be made businesses would significantly benefit from a diverse panel that has the expertise knowledge to understand the possible consequences of artificial intelligence integrated systems. Within the process of using artificial intelligence there should be appropriate guidelines put in place to ensure quality assurance and traceability of artificial intelligence systems.
