Whilst completing the Data Visualisation section I initially struggled to display the graph in Pycharm. After researching, I found the solution was to go to View -> Scientific View, which opened up a new tab in PyCharm. After some more research into a basic graph that I could get up and running I was able to display a simple graph. This let me know that the graph feature was working and that the issue was someonewhere in my code. Using the holidays destinations as an example for my data source, i made an Excel for it then saved it as a csv and then imported it into Pycharm. I then took each section of data I wanted and assigned it to its own variable. One for the x axis and one for the y axis. Then the graph appears. But the names are all overlapping each other. This was because some of my data had overlapping values and so it got put on top of each other. I fixed this by changing the graph design and values. I then looked at how to add axis labels and a title. I also looked at how to change the colour of my values and rotation. For the Correlation graph I initially assigned everything to its own values and had about 20 lines of code. After some more research I cut down my code to almost half the size and it made my code look more readable. I then fiddled around with the correlation graph line colour and the values colours and then came to my final graph which can be seen above.
